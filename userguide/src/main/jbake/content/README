The file attributes.conf defines several attributes (variables) that
need to be customized for each technology.

The *.adoc files should not be modified.

The following "include" files should be customized as necessary
for the specific technology:

- rules.inc

	Additional compatibility rules needed by some technologies.
	The rules in rules.adoc should NOT be changed.

- config.inc

	Detailed instructions for configuring the TCK, included in
	Chapter 4.  Unfortunately, these are sections 4.1 - 4.3,
	so even if the TCK doesn't require 3 sections you need to
	make up something, or else change the sections to "N/A".

- packages.inc

	A simple list of Jakarta EE package names for the technology.

- tck-packages.inc

	A list of additional software packages included in the TCK.


Note that this template is NOT sufficient for the Jakarta EE platform
or Jakarta EE Web Profile.
